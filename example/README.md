  Professional README Generator
  # Boyd Stacken

  The motivation to for this application was to dynamically create a professional README.md file generator from a user's input with using the inquier. This app allows for a user to create a README.md in a untraditional way and get themselves familair with using the inquirer package in node js. It's easier now to understand what is required in order process this information on the backend.
