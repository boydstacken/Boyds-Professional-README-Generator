# Professional README Generator

## Description

The motivation to for this application was to dynamically create a professional README.md file generator from a user's input with using the inquier. This app allows for a user to create a README.md in a untraditional way and get themselves familair with using the inquirer package in node js. It's easier now to understand what is required in order process this information on the backend.

## Installation

Do a npm install in the terminal to get all the npm packages.

Ensure you have other proper packages included to run this application (inquirer, fs, and the generateMarkdown). All essential to create your custom application. 

As required, ensure you use online resources in github to find badge options, so when the prompts are ran and the README is generated you can sucessfully showcase the badge and link in your generated README.

Create an example folder where the user's generated README can store and you can view how user in put is displayed (the preview file works great for a formal replica of how it will look in github).

Record the walkthrough of the user prompts in node js and store the file link in the README.

Install npm packages, in the index.js file include packages for application (inquirer,fs, generateMarkDown ), create a choice (object)of badges with an array using an if/else statement, implment iquirer prompt with criteria for the different questions, create a .then response file and generate a function to write your example README file. Use console log along the way to test for errors.

On the generateMarkdown.js file, create functions that returns a license badge, license links, and returns the license section of README based on choices user selects. Use console log along the way to test for errors.

After code is implemented run the cmd "node index.js" in the terminal in your working path directory, checkout the READMe file generated under the example folder and use the preview mode to visually see how the README is structured.
